# Phishing-Mail-Classifier
conduct a comparative assessment between various classification algorithms techniques, and various features. Moreover, the goal includes the development of multi-classifier integration model by combining more than one classification technique to enhance detection and protecting against phishing emails.
The objectives of this research are as follows:
-	Determine and evaluate the best set of features to be used for phishing Emails detection using Manual feature selection based on the email structure.
-	To determine the best classification algorithm for phishing detection.
-	To fine tune the classification algorithm for best performance.
-	Design a system which integrate multiple classification algorithms for phishing emails detection and to evaluate such integration.
